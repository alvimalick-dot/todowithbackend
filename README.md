This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Email OTP verification

Both **registration** and **login** use a two-step, email-verified flow: enter credentials, then enter the 6-digit code emailed to the account address via [Resend](https://resend.com).

- New accounts are created unverified and are only activated once the emailed code is confirmed.
- The code is bound to the account that passed the credential step, stored only as a hash, expires after 10 minutes, is single-use, and is rate-limited (5 attempts → 10-minute lockout, 1 resend per minute).
- Pending tokens from the code step can never be used as session cookies.

Set these variables in `.env.local`:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=You <you@yourdomain.com>   # must be a verified sender in Resend
# EMAIL_FROM=...  # optional alias for RESEND_FROM_EMAIL
```

If `RESEND_API_KEY` is not set (local development), the OTP is printed to the server terminal instead of emailed, so the flow stays testable.

Create an API key at https://resend.com/api-keys.
